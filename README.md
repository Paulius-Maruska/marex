Google App Engine **Ma**p **R**duce **Ex**tensions.

[Google App Engine MapReduce library](http://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/) is really cool and feature rich.
There are, however, things that it is missing. Things that could be improved. Things that could be integrated.

That is why I decided to create [marex](/Paulius-Maruska/marex).
